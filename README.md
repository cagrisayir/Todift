# Todift: To-do App 

This is a To-do app made with Swift, SwiftUI, and Firebase by cagrisayir. 

### Technologies and features that I used: 
* Firebase Auth
* Firestore
* Onboarding
* Splash Screen (Animated)
* Addmob

## Milestone #1 - Create the Login and the register page with Firebase Auth

## Milestone #2 - Create Firestore models for todos and fetch the data from the database. 

## Milestone #3 - Add Onboarding and Animated Splash Screen to the project. ✅ 
* ### ✅ The onboarding screen is shown only the first time. If you delete and reinstall the app you will see it again.
* ### ✅ Splash screen waiting for 3 seconds. Then we are navigating the main screen. It is animated.
